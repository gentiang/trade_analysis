# Kosovo Trade Analysis
This analysis provides an overview of the main trade indicators for Kosovo. The data was collected from the Comext - the European Comission's database for international trade, and analysed as well as visualized in RStudio. You can find the source code in this repo, but the dataset is too large to be uploaded (~2GB) and is therefore available only upon request.

The dataset contains monthly data from January, 2004 until June, 2022 and will be updated regularly.

A short analysis based on the data can be found [here](https://medium.com/@gentiangsh/a-quick-look-at-inflation-in-kosovo-2ef2227bd638).
